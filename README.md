# ai-bio-annotator

BioAnnotate leverages the Google Gemini AI to automatically identify and annotate parts of scientific diagrams, creating interactive lessons to make learning science more accessible and engaging.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Upload any biological diagram (cells, anatomy, etc.) and let the AI identify the key components.
*   **Precise Highlighting:** The AI generates detailed SVG polygon outlines that trace the exact anatomical boundaries of each structure, not just simple boxes.
*   **Rich Annotations:** For each identified part, the tool displays a description, a simple analogy for better understanding, and its primary biological function.
*   **Automated Quiz Generation:** Instantly creates a multiple-choice quiz based on the diagram's content to test user knowledge.
*   **Interactive & Animated UI:** A clean interface with smooth animations, powered by Anime.js, provides a polished and responsive user experience.

## How It Works

The application uses a secure client-server architecture to protect the user's API key and handle the AI processing.

1.  **User Interaction (Frontend):** The user provides their Google AI API key and uploads an image through the web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2.  **Secure Request (Backend):** The frontend sends this data to a backend server built with Node.js and Express.js.
3.  **AI Analysis (Cloud):** The backend server securely makes a request to the Google Gemini API (`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`), sending the image along with a detailed prompt that instructs the AI to perform a precise analysis.
4.  **Structured Data Response:** The Gemini API returns a structured JSON object containing a summary, quiz questions, and an array of annotations with labels, descriptions, and polygon coordinates.
5.  **Dynamic Visualization (Frontend):** The frontend JavaScript parses this JSON data and dynamically renders the results, drawing the SVG polygon highlights over the image and building the summary and quiz sections.

## Running Instructions

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** You must have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Google AI API Key:** You need an API key for the Gemini API. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). You may need to enable billing on your Google Cloud project to avoid hitting the free-tier rate limits.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-bio-annotator.git
    cd ai-bio-annotator
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Start the backend server. It will listen on `http://localhost:3000`.
        ```bash
        node server.js
        ```
    *   **Keep this terminal window running.**

3.  **Run the Frontend**
    *   Open a new terminal window or tab.
    *   Navigate to the `frontend` directory from the project's root folder.
    *   There is no build step needed. Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

4.  **Use the Application**
    *   Paste your Google AI API Key into the designated input field.
    *   Upload a scientific diagram.
    *   Click "Analyze with AI" and wait for the results to appear.
